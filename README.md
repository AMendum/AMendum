## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Annabel and I'm a Master's student studying Data Analytics and Computational Social Science at UMass Amherst. 

I'm currently working on a project analyzing survey data from the Study on U.S. Parentsâ€™ Divisions of Labor During COVID-19 to gain insights about how pandemic-related closures affected domestic work and childcare in American families. I'm also collecting data from MBTA's API to understand trends in train alerts. 

I'm currently learning R, Python, and SQL.
